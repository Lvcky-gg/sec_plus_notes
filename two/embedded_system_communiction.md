## 5G

- fifth gen cellular networking
- significance performance increases
- significant IoT impact

## Subscriber Identity Module(SIM)

- SIM card: universal integrated circuit card
- used to provide information to a cellular network provider
- contains mobile details
  - IMSI
  - auth information
- important to manage

## Narrowband

- communication analog signals over narrow range of frequencies
- many IoT devices communicate over long distances - SCADA

## baseband

- generally a single cable with digital signal
- communication signal uses all of the bandwidth
- bi-directional communication
- Ethernet standard - 100base-tx

## Zigbee

- internet of things networking- open standard IEEE 802.15.4 PAN
- alternative to wifi and bluetooth
  - longer distance than bluetooth
  - less power consumed than wifi
- mesh network of all zigbee devices in your home
- uses the ISM band
