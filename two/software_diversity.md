# Software Diversity

## Exploiting an application

- attackers often exploit application vulnerabilities
- once you exploit one binary, you can exploit them all
- but what if they ran different binaries?

## Software Diversity

- alternate compiler paths would result in different binaries each time
  - each app would be slightly different
- an attack vs different binaries would only be successful on a fraction of users
