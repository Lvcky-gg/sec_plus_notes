# Edge and Fog Computing

## Cloud Computing

- computing on demand
  - instantly available cloud computing
  - massive data storage capability
- fast implementation
- not always the best
  - latency
  - limited bandwidth
  - difficult to protect data
  - requires internet

## Edge Computing

- IoT devices have specific functions and require huge data
- Edge
  - process data on edge server
  - close to user
- often process on the device itself
  - no latency
  - increased speed and performance
  - process where the data is

## Fog Computing

- Fog
  - cloud that is close to your data
  - Internet of THings - cloud computing
- distributed cloud architecture extends the cloud
- distribute the data and processing
  - immediate data stays local
  - local decisions made from local data
  - no bandwidth requirements
  - private data never leaves
  - long term analysis can occur in cloud
