# Cryptography Concepts

## Cryptography = greek, kryptos: Secret

- confidentiality
- authentication and access control
- non-repudiation
- integrity

## Cryptography Terms

- plaintext = unencrypted
- ciphertext = the encrypted message
- cipher - the encryption algo
- cryptanalysis
  - the art of cracking encryption

## Cryptographic keys

- keys: add the key to the cypher to encryption
- some encryption methods use one key

## Give weak keys a workout

- a weak key is a weak key
- make it stronger by performing multiple processes
- brute force attacks would require reversing each of those hashes

## Key Stretching Libraries

- already built for oyur app
- bcrypt: generate hashes from passwords, uses blowfish
- password based key derivation function 2(PBKDF2)

## Lightweight Cryptography

- powerful cryptography has historically required strength
- IOT devices have limited powerful
- new standards being created by National Institute of Standards and Technology

## Homomorphic Encryption(HE)

- encrypted data is difficult to work with

- homomorphic can perform operations on encrypted data

- secure cloud storage

- research data without viewing
