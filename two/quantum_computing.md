# Quantum Computing

- computer based quantum physics
- classical mechanics
  - smallest form of info
  - bits are zeros and ones
- quantum mechanics
  - smallest form of data is qubit
  - bits are ones, zeros and any combo in-between at the same time
- search quickly through large datasets
- simulate quantum world

## Post quantum cryptography

- breaks existing encryption
- issues
  - no crypto could be trusted
  - finances are in danger
  - no data privacy
- time for updated crypto
- NTRU
  - cryptosystem using lattice theory
  - relies on closest vector problem
  - instead of finding prime factorizations of large numbers

## Quantum Communication

- protect against eavesdropping
  - Quantum Key Distribution
- create unbreakable encryption
- eavesdropping would modify the datasets
