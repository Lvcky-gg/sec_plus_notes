# Physical Security Controls

## Barricades Bollards

- prevent access
- channels people to access point
- identifies safety concerns and prevents accidents
- can be used to an extreme

## Access control Vesiticles

- all doors are normally  unlocked
  - opening one door causes others to lock
- all doors are normally locked
  - opening door prevents others from being unlocked
- one door / other locked
  - when one door is open / other locked
- one at a time controlled groups

## Alarms

- circuit based
- motion detected
- duress

## Signs

- clear and specific instructions
- consider personal safety

## Video(CCTV)

- can replace physical guards
- features are important
- often many different cameras

## Industrial camouflage

- conceal an important facility in plain sight
- protects a data center

## Guards and access lists

- security guards

## Proper lighting

- more light means more security
- specialized designed

## Fencing

- build a perimeter
- transparant or opaque
- prevent climbing

## Fire Suppression

- electronics require unique response to fire
- detection
- suppress with chemicals

## Sensors

- motion detectors
- noise detection
- proximity reader
- moisture detection
- temperature

## Drones

- quickly cover large areas
- site surveys, physical security, damage assessments
- on-board Sensors

## Faraday cage

- blocks em fields
- mesh of conductive materials
- not comprehensive in all types of signals
- can restrict mobile access

## Screened subnet

- DMZ, an additional layer between you and the internet

## Protected Distribution

- Protected distribution system(PDS)
- protect cables adn fibers
- prevent cuts and taps
- prevent fiber taps
- hardened protected distribution system
