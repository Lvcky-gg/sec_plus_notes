## SAN Replication

- share data between different devices
- storage area networks(SAN)
- san-to-san replication: duplicate from one center to another
- SAN snapshot: create a state of data based on point in time

## VM replication

- virtual machine redundancy
- it really is just one big file
- consistent service offering
- recover from replicated copy
- efficient copying

## On-premise vs cloud redundancy

- speed
- money
- security
