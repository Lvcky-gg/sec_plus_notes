# Embedded Systems

- hardware and software designed for a specific function or to operate as part of a larger Systems
- is built with this task in mind

## SoC(System on a Chip)

- multiple components running on a single Chip
- small form factor
- security considerations are important

## Field Programmable Gate Array(FPGA)

- integrated circuit that can be configured after manufacturing
- problem doesn't require hardware replacement
- common infrastructure

## SCADA/ICS4

- supervisory control and data aquisition Systems
  - Industrial Control Systems(ICS)
- PC manages equipment
- distributed control Systems- requires extensive segmentation

## Smart Devices / IoT(Internet of Things)

- sensors
- smart devices
- wearable tech
- facility automation
- weak defaults

## Specialized

- medical care
- vehicles
- aircraft
- smart meters

## VOIP

- voice over internet protocol
  - instead of analog phone line
  - Plain old telephone service
- relatively complex embedded system
- each device is a computer

## HVAC

- heating, ventilation and air conditioning
- complex
- pc manages equipment
- traditionally built without security in mind

## drones

- flying vehicles
- may be manually controlled from the ground

## printers, scanners and fax machines

- all in one multifunction devices(MFD)
- no onger a simple printer
- some images are stored locally on device
- logs are stored on device

## RTOS(Real Time Operating System)

- operating system with deterministic processing schedule
  - no time to wait for other processes
  - industrial equipment, autos
  - military
- extremely sensitive to security
  - non trivial
  - need to always be available
  - difficult to know what security is in place

## Surveilance Systems

- video/audio surveilance
- secure the security system
- physically difficult to replace cameras
