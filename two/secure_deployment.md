# Secure Deployments

## Development to Production

- deploy it safe and reliably
- patch
- manage the process

## Sandboxing

- isolated test environment
  - no connection to real world or prod systems
  - technological safe space
- use during development process
- incremental development: helps build application

## Building the application

- development
- test

## Verify the application

- QA: verifies features, functionality and old errors are gone
- staging: almost ready to roll out, feels like prod release, copy of prod data

## Use application

- production: application is live and used

## Secure baselines

- security of application should be well defined
- integrity measurements check for secure baseline
