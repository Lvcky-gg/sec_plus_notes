- plan for change
- automated courses of action
- continuous monitoring
- configuration validation

## Continuous Integration(CI)

- code is constantly written
- so many opportunities for vulnerability
- basic set of security checks should be implemented during development
- large scale security analysis during testing phase

## Continuous Delivery/Deployment(CD)

- Continuous delivery
