# Configuration

- The only constant is change
- identify and document hardware and software settings
- rebuild those systems if a disaster occurs

## Diagrams

- Network diagrams - document the physical wire and device
- physical data center rack locations
- device diagrams - individual cabling

## Baseling configurations

- the security of an application environment should be well defined
  - all app instances should follow this baseline
  - firewall settings, patch levels, OS file versions
  - may require constant updates
- Integrity measurements check for the secure baseline
  - these should be performed often
  - check against well documented baselines
  - failure requires an immediate correction

## Standard naming conventions

- create a standard
- devices
- network: port labeling
- domain configurations
  - user names, emails

## IP schema

- an IP address plan or model
- locations
- IP ranges
- reserved addresses
