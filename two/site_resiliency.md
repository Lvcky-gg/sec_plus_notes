# Site Resiliency

- recovery site is prepped
- a disaster is called
- problem is addressed
- revert back to primary location

## Hot site

- exact replica - duplicate everything
- stocked with hardware, constantly updated, two of everything
- applications and software are constantly updated
- flip a switch and everything is moved

## Cold Site

- no hardware
- no data
- no people

## Warm Site

- somewhere between cold and hot
- big room with rack space
- hardware is ready and waiting
