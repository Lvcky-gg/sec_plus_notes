# Biometrics

## Biometric factors

- fingerprint scanners
- retinal scanners
- iris scanners
- voice recognition
- facial recognition
- gait analysis
- veins

## Biometric Acceptance Rate

- false acceptance rate(FAR)
  - likelihood that a biometric measure will allow the wrong person access
  - not sensitive enough
- False Rejection Rate(FAR)
  - rejection of proper user
  - too sensitive
- Crossover Error Rate(CER)
  - overall accuracy of biometric system
  - the rate of FAR and FRR are equal
  - adjust sensitivity to equalize both values
