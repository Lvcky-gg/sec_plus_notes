# Infrastructure As Code

- describe an infrastructure: define servers network and applications as code
- modify the infrastructure and create versions
- use the description to build other application instances
- important concept: build a perfect version every time

## SDN(Software Defined Networking)

- networking devices have two functional planes of operation: data, control
- directly programmable
- agile: can change dynamically
- programaticically configured
- open standards / vendor neutral

## SDV(Software Defined Visibility)

- you must see the traffic to secure the data
- dynamic deployments include security and network visibility devices
- data is encapsulated and encrypted
  - VXLAN and SSL/TLS
- new tech can change what you see
- security devices monitor application traffic
- visibility expands as the application instances expand
- application flows can be controlled by API
