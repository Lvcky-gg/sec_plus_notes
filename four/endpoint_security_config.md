# Endpoint Security Configuration

## The Endpoint

- the end user device
- many ways to exploit a system
- security team has to recover all of the bases

## Application approved/deny lists

- any application can be dangerous
- approved list: nothing runs unless approved, restrictive
- deny list : nothing on bad list can run, not as restrictive
- quarantine : anything suspicious is moved to a safe area
