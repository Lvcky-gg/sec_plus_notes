# Incident Response Process

## Security Incidents

- user clicks an email and executes malware
- DDoS
- confidential information is stolen
- User installs peer-to-peer software and allows external access to internal servers

## Roles and Responsibilities

- incident response team
- IT security management
- compliance officers
- technical staff
- user community

## NIST SP800-61(National Institute of Standards and Technology)

- computer security incident handling guide

## Preparing for an incident

- comms method
- incident handling hardware and software
- resources
- mitigation software
- policies need to be in place

## Challenge of detection

- many different detection sources
- a large amount of volume
- incidents are almost always complex

## Incident precursors

- an incident may occur in the future
- web server logs : vulnerability scanner in use
- exploit announcement
- direct threats

## Incident indicators

- an attack is underway or success ful
- buffer overflow : identified by an intrusion detection/prevention system
- host based monitor detects config Change
- network traffic flows deviate from the norm

## Isolation and Containment

- generally a bad thing to let things run their course
- sandboxes
  - an isolated OS
  - run malware and analyze the results
  - clean out the sandbox when done
- isolation can be problematic

## Recovery after incident

- get things back to normal
- eradicate the bug
- recover the system

## Reconstitution

- a phased approach
- recovery may take months
- plan should be efficient

## Lessons learned

- learn and improve
- post-incident meeting
- dont wait too long

## Answer the questions

- what happened?
- how did your incident plans work?
- what would you do differently
- what indicators would you watch for?
