# Penetration Testing

- similar to an attack
- similar to active vulnerability scanning
- often a compliance mandate
- National Institute of Standards and Technology Technical guide to Information Security Testing

## Rules of Engagement

- an important doc that defines purpose and scope
- type of testing and schedule
- the rules

## Working Knowledge

- how much do you know about the testing
- an unknown environment is when the pentester goes in blind
- a partially known environment is when the pentester knows some things

## Exploiting Vulnerabilities

- try to break the service, but be careful of DoS
- may need to try multiple vulnerabilities
- youll know you are vulnerable if you can bypass security

## The Process

- initial exploitation - get into the network
- lateral movement from system to system
- persistence: keep yourself in, and have a way back in
- the pivot: gain access to systems that wouldnt otherwise be accesible

## Pentest Aftermath

- cleanup
  - revert to original state
  - remove binaries or temp file
  - remove backdoor
  - delete accounts
- bug bounty
  - reward for discovering vulnerabilities
  - earn money for hacking
  - document it
