# Vulnerability scans

- minimally invasive, usually
- port scanning
- identify systems
- gather info

## scan types

- non-intrusive: only scan
- intrusive: test the vulnerability
- non-credentialed scans: scanner cannot login
- credentialed scan: scanner can login

## Identify vulnerabilities

- scanner looks for everything
- application scans
- web app scans
- network scans

## vulnerability research

- [National Vulnerability Database](http://nvd.nist.gov/)
  -1\[[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures(CVE)](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/)
- [Microsoft Security Bulletins](http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/current.aspx)
- some vulnerabilities cannot be identified
- [National Vulnerability Database](http://nvd.nist.gov/)
- CVSS Common Vulnerability Scoring System
  - scores vulnerability -0 through 10
  - standards change in time
  - different scoring for CVVS 2.0 and CVVS 3.x

## Vulnerability Scan Log Review

- lack of firewall controls:
  - no firewall
  - no antivirus
  - no anti spyware
- real vulnerabilities

## Dealing With False Positives

- a false positive is a vulnerability that does not actually exist
- low-severity vulnerabilites aren't your priority
- false negatives: vulnerability does exist but wasn't detected
- update to latest signature
- work with vulnerability detection manufacturer

## Configuration review

- validate security of device configurations
- workstation configuration
- server settings
- security device rules
