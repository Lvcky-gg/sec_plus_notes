# Network Segmentation

- physical, logical or virtual Segmentation
- performance: high bandwidth
- security
- compliance

## Physical Segmentation

- devices are physically seperate
- must be connected to provide communication
- web servers on one rack, db on another

## Logical segmentation with VLANS

- virtual local area network(VLAN)
- separated logically

## Screened Subnet

- previously called the DMZ
- additional layer of security between you and the internet
- public access and resources

## Extranet

- a private network for partners
- usually requires authentication

## Intranet

- private network: only available internally
- no external traffic

## East-West traffic

- traffic flows in a data center
- east East-West
  - traffic between devices in the same data center
  - relatively fast response times

## Zero trust

- many networks are relatively open in the middle
- zero trust is a holistic approach to network security
- everything must be verified, nothing may be trusted
