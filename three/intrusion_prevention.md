# Intrusion Prevention

## NIDS and NIPS

- Intrusion Detection System: watch network traffic
- intrusions
- detection : alarm or alert
- Prevention stop it before it gets out of hand

## Passive monitoring

- examine a copy of the traffic
- port mirror(SPAN) traffic

## Out of Band response

- when malicious traffic is identified
  - IPS sends TCP reset frames
  - after the fact
  - limited UDP response available

## In line monitoring

- IDS/IPS sits physically inline

## In band response

- malicious traffic is identified

## Identification technologies

- signature based
- anomaly based
- heuristic
