# Securing Cloud Networks

## Cloud Networks

- connect cloud components
- users communicate on the cloud
- cloud devices communicate between each other

## Virtual Networks

- cloud contains virtual devices
- virtual switches, virtual routers
- the network changes with the rest of the infrastructure

## Public and Private Subnets

- private Cloud
  - all internal IP address
  - connect to the private cloud over a VPN
  - no access from the internet
- public cloud
  - external IP addresses
  - connect to the cloud from anywhere
- hybrid cloud
  - combine internal cloud resources with external
  - may combine public and private

## Segmentation

- the cloud contains separate VPC, containers and microservices
- Separation is a security opportunity
- virtual security technology
  - web application firewall
  - next generation firewall
  - intrusion prevention system

## API Inspection and Integration

- microservice architecture is the underlying application engine
- API calls can include risk
- API monitoring
