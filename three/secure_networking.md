# Secure Networking

## Domain Name Resolution

- DNS security in the original design
- DNSSEC: domain name security extensions
- validate DNS responses
- public key cryptography

## Using a DNS for security

- stop end users from visiting dangerous sites

- a query to a known malicious address can identify infected system

- content filtering to prevent DNS queries to unwanted suspect sites

## Out of band management

- the network isn't available
- most devices have seperate management interface
- connect a modem
- console router

## The need for QoS

- many different devices
- many different applications
- different apps have different networking requirements
- some apps are more important

## QoS quality of Service

- prioritize traffic performance
- quality of Service
- many different methods

## IPv6 security is different

- more IP address space
- no need for NAT
- some attacks disappear
- new attacks may appear
- IPsec ready or built in

## Taps and port mirrors

- intercept network traffic
- physical Taps
- port mirrors

## Monitoring service

- constant cyber security monitoring
- identify threats
- respond to events
- maintain compliance

## FIM (FILE INTEGRITY MONITORING)

- some files are always changing
- monitor important OS and app files
- windows SFC(System File Checker)
- linux - tripwire
